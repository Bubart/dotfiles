# dotfiles

This is yet another reboot to my dotfiles config.

I've decided to switch to using `lua` for my `nvim` config as well as using `fish` for my default `shell` and `starship` for my shell prompt.

## Tools

1. `exa` for `ls`
2. `nvim` for my `$EDITOR`
3. `lua` for my `nvim` configs
4. `fish` for my `shell`
5. `starship` for my prompt
